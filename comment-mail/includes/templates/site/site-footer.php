 * @var string $site_footer_easy Parsed easy footer template file.
 *    This is a partial footer template, incorporated into this full template file;
 *    i.e. a simpler fragment that fits into this larger picture here.
 *
 * @note This file is automatically included as a child of other templates.
 *    Therefore, this template will ALSO receive any variable(s) passed to the parent template file,
 *    where the parent automatically calls upon this template. In short, if you see a variable documented in
 *    another template file, that particular variable will ALSO be made available in this file too;
 *    as this file is automatically included as a child of other parent templates.
